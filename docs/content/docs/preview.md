title: Documentation Preview
---

The `docs:preview` task provides an opiniated solution for previewing the documentation for this project locally.

It sets some expectations on the local project setup:

- [`telescopium`](https://github.com/code0-tech/telescopium) is cloned in the same directory as `pictor`.
- The directory containing this project is named `pictor`.

All requirements of the `telescopium` project itself apply as well. More information about them are
available in the [telescopium documentation](../../telescopium/preview.md).
